# ALX Listing App

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a clone of the Airbnb listing page, allowing users to explore and interact with various property listings. The app demonstrates core web development concepts such as component-based architecture, reusable interfaces, and static asset management.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- **components/**: Contains reusable UI elements and layout components used throughout the app (e.g., listing cards, search bars, headers, footers).
- **interfaces/**: Defines TypeScript interfaces and types that ensure consistency and type safety for data structures used in the app.
- **constants/**: Stores fixed values and configuration data (such as API endpoints, default settings, or static lists) to maintain consistency and facilitate easy updates.
- **public/assets/**: Holds static files such as images, icons, and other assets that are publicly accessible and used by the application.
